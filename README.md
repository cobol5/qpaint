qpaint
======

A QBasic image editor program I wrote when I was 14. Looking back on this I'm pretty impressed - it worked and provided some real utility. I wish I could recover more of my projects but they've been lost to time.

I used this program to generate images for other games I made in high school, like Midnight Craving, Ian Goes Crazy, and Kill Anthony :D
